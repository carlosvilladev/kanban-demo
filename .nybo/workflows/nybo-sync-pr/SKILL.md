name: nybo-sync-pr
description: >-
  Retroactively link a merged pull request to a spec whose status.yaml lacks
  pr_url or carries a stale branch name. Uses gh + git log + reasoning to find
  the matching PR, confirms with the user, rewrites status.yaml (pr_url,
  pr_number, branch, and — if merged — status: shipped + shipped_at). Runs
  either on one feature or scans all specs lacking pr_url. Triggers on
  "sync PR", "link PR", "nybo-sync-pr", or a spec stuck in PR Ready without
  a link.

# nybo-sync-pr

Backfills PR metadata on specs that shipped before PR tracking was wired up,
or whose `branch:` field drifted from the actual PR head branch. Closes the
"Verified / PR Ready card with no link" gap.

**Usage:**

```
/nybo-sync-pr                    # scan all docs/*/status.yaml lacking pr_url
/nybo-sync-pr <feature>          # target one spec
/nybo-sync-pr <feature> --pr 3   # explicit assignment (skip discovery)
/nybo-sync-pr <feature> --pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/3
/nybo-sync-pr <feature> --force  # re-sync even if pr_url already set
```

---

## 1. Resolve input

- If `<feature>` is given: read `docs/<feature>/status.yaml`.
- If no `<feature>`: enumerate every `docs/*/status.yaml`; keep specs where
  `pr_url` is absent (or `--force`).
- If `--pr <n-or-url>` is passed: skip discovery (section 2), go to section 3.

If the spec's `status.yaml` is missing, emit a warning and skip — do not fail
the whole run.

---

## 2. Discovery — find the matching merged PR

Work through these heuristics in order. Stop at the first **high-confidence**
match; otherwise collect candidates from multiple heuristics and present them
in section 4.

### 2a. Exact branch match (high confidence)

```
gh pr list --state merged --head "<status.yaml .branch>" \
  --json number,url,headRefName,mergedAt,title,body,state
```

- Exactly one hit → high confidence, proceed.
- Zero hits → branch may be stale or deleted; continue to 2b.
- Multiple hits → rare (branch reused); medium confidence, surface all.

### 2b. Spec slug in PR title (high-to-medium confidence)

```
gh pr list --state merged --search "<spec-slug> in:title" \
  --json number,url,headRefName,mergedAt,title,body,state --limit 20
```

Use the spec's directory name as the slug (e.g., `fix-dashboard-verified-column`).
Score each hit by whether the title *starts with* the slug, *contains* it as a
whole word, or merely mentions it.

### 2c. Merge-commit grep (medium confidence, works offline after `gh` fetch)

```
git log --all --grep "Merge pull request.*<spec-slug>" --oneline
```

Extract `#N` from matches, then `gh pr view <N> --json ...` for each. Handles
branches already deleted on origin.

### 2d. Semantic fallback (low confidence — always confirm with user)

If none of the above yield a hit:

```
gh pr list --state merged --limit 50 \
  --json number,url,headRefName,mergedAt,title,body,state
```

Read spec intention from `docs/<feature>/spec.md` (or the `notes:` field in
status.yaml if spec.md is absent) and reason about which PR titles/bodies
describe the same work. Propose the top 1–3 candidates with your reasoning.

---

## 3. Explicit assignment

If the user passed `--pr <value>`:

- If numeric: `gh pr view <N> --json number,url,headRefName,mergedAt,state,title`
- If URL: extract number from `/pull/(\d+)$`, same view call.

If `gh pr view` returns a non-zero status, report the failure and exit
without writing — never invent PR metadata.

---

## 4. Confirm with the user

For each spec, show:

```
Spec: <feature>
Current status:  <status>
Current branch:  <branch>
Current pr_url:  <pr_url or "—">

Candidate:
  PR #<N> — <title>
  Branch:     <headRefName>
  State:      <MERGED|OPEN|CLOSED>
  Merged at:  <mergedAt or "—">
  URL:        <url>
  Confidence: <high|medium|low>   via <heuristic>
  [alternate candidates, if any]

Apply? (y / n / skip)
```

- **y**: proceed to section 5.
- **n**: show next alternate candidate if any; else ask the user to provide
  an explicit `--pr <n>`.
- **skip**: leave this spec untouched, move to the next.

Always confirm when:
- Confidence is `low`.
- Multiple candidates tied at the same confidence level.
- The spec already has a different `pr_url` set (`--force` was passed).

For `high` confidence single matches under the trust level `autonomous`,
you *may* apply without prompt — but print the resolution. The skill is
always safe to be interactive; batch-apply is not a goal.

---

## 5. Apply — write to status.yaml

Read `docs/<feature>/status.yaml`, update these fields (preserve all others):

```yaml
pr_url: <url>
pr_number: <number>
branch: <headRefName>   # corrects stale branch if different
```

Then, branching on the PR `state`:

- **MERGED**:
  - `status: shipped`
  - `shipped_at: <mergedAt>`
  - `pr_status: merged`
- **OPEN**:
  - `pr_status: open`
  - Do **not** advance status — sync-pr's job is linkage, not premature shipping.
- **CLOSED** (not merged):
  - `pr_status: closed`
  - Do **not** advance status. Print a warning so the user knows the linked
    PR was abandoned — they may want to pick a different candidate.

Write the YAML back. Other fields (`task_count`, `domains_referenced`,
`notes`, dates, etc.) must be preserved verbatim.

---

## 6. Log the event

Append one entry per synced spec to `.nybo/events.jsonl`:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "<ISO now>",
  "type": "pr_synced",
  "actor": "<human|agent>",
  "details": {
    "spec": "<feature>",
    "pr_number": <N>,
    "pr_state": "MERGED|OPEN|CLOSED",
    "branch_before": "<old>",
    "branch_after": "<new>",
    "status_before": "<old>",
    "status_after": "<new>",
    "confidence": "high|medium|low",
    "heuristic": "branch|title|commit|semantic|explicit",
    "trigger": "sync-pr"
  }
}
```

---

## 7. Confirm to the user

Report a one-line summary per spec handled:

```
✓ <feature>  →  PR #<N> ({MERGED|OPEN|CLOSED}, merged 2026-04-22)  status: pr-ready → shipped
⚠ <feature>  →  PR candidate found with LOW confidence, left unchanged (run with --pr <n> to force)
— <feature>  →  already synced, skipped
```

---

## Idempotency

- If `pr_url` is already set and matches the discovered candidate → report
  "already synced", skip without writing.
- If `pr_url` is set but doesn't match, stop and ask — never silently
  re-assign (user may have deliberately linked an alternate PR). `--force`
  overrides after explicit consent.

---

## What this skill does NOT do

- **Create a PR** — that's `/nybo-ship`. This skill only links existing ones.
- **Unlink** an already-assigned PR — edit `status.yaml` by hand for now.
- **Modify the PR itself** — only local `status.yaml` + events.jsonl are touched.
- **Advance status on OPEN PRs** — use `/nybo-ship` or `/nybo-curate` for that
  transition; `/nybo-sync-pr` refuses to guess whether the PR is also the
  trigger for "PR Ready".

---

## Failure modes (degrade gracefully)

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `gh` not installed | Skip `gh` heuristics; fall back to `git log` only; warn. |
| `gh` not authenticated | Same as above. Print: "gh not authenticated; run `gh auth login`." |
| No network / origin unreachable | Rely on `git log` local history. |
| No candidates found across all heuristics | Report "no candidates", suggest `--pr <n>` or leaving the spec alone. |
| User rejects all candidates | Exit the spec, move on. No write. |

Never write a partial status.yaml. Either all fields update or none.

---

## File locations

- **Input:** `docs/<feature>/status.yaml`, `docs/<feature>/spec.md` (for semantic fallback)
- **Output:** `docs/<feature>/status.yaml`, `.nybo/events.jsonl`
- **Git domain rules:** `.nybo/memory/domains/git.md` (branch naming, PR targets)
- **Dependencies:** `gh` CLI (primary), `git` (local history fallback)
